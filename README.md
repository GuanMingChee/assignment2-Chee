## favorite place/location: Tahiti
It is one of the best getaway places. It is the largest of French Polynesia's islands. You can swim with **humpback whales** from **August to October** as female whales come to give birth by the island. There are also lots of marine creatures such as sharks, rays and dolphins in which you should schedule a **watch tour** if not a **swimming/snorkeling** chance!
