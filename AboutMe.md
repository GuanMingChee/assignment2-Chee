I am from an island in Malaysia. A game that I palyed for more than 10 years is Mousehunt. I like to play martial arts but I am afraid of myself being hurt, which is pretty conflicting. I am a competitive person so I will be serious in both work and play, in which others will sometimes feel stressed around me.
